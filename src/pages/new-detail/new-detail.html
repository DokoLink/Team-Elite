    <b [@fadeInUp]="logoState">Starting today, Monday December 12, Valve will launch the 7.00 update which refreshes Dota 2 once again and marks the beginning of a new era.</b>
    <p [@fadeInUp]="logoState">After ten years spent with the 6.xx version, from 2005 to 2016, Valve takes a huge step forward with the release of 7.00. Dota 2 as we knew it for such a long time will change completely, the 7.00 patch being released with four big update categories. From game mechanics, map and hud changes, to hero and item reworks, Dota 2 is now a whole new game that will indeed take us on A New Journey.</p>
    <h3 [@fadeInUp]="logoState">New Hero:</h3>
    <p>Monkey King will now make his entrance in the hero pool, but not in the captain's mode. A master of trickery, Monkey King is not an illusion based hero as many would have expected, instead he brings a new concept to the game. Mischief, one of his abilities allows Monkey King to shape shift using the surrounding environment as inspiration. For example, he can morph into a rune, Courier, a tree from the jungle, a dropped branch on the ground or, if used in the Roshan pit, Monkey King can take the appearance of the Aegis.</p>

    <h3>New Gameplay:</h3>
    <p>This is where the New Journey truly begins. Brace yourselves because the amount of changes might be overwhelming. It will for sure take a while for all of us to adjust to and learn the new stuff.
First of all, a talent tree for each hero has been added and it’s available from level 10. There are a total of four talent points that opens every other 5 levels (10, 15, 20 and 25) and the perks differ from hero to hero.
Second of all, ultimates levels have changed. The new ultimates levels are 6/12/18. Experience, gold and bounty gain, respawn timetable, death cost, everything has been changed.
To make it even more of a wild trip, Valve has changed the map entirely. As every jungle entrance is made via terraced terrain, all the jungle paths are changed, neutral camps have been relocated, a new Ancient camp has been added, most of the “old” warding spots do not exist anymore and the Roshan pit has been moved next to the top rune spawn location.</p>
